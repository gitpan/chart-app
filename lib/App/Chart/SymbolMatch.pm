=head1 NAME

App::Chart::SymbolMatch -- loose matching of symbols

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use App::Chart::SymbolMatch;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is used for loose symbol entry on the command line and in the
Open dialog (see L<App::Chart::Gtk2::OpenDialog>).  It's only a separate
module to keep a tricky bit of code away from other things.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=over 4

=item C<< ($symbol, $symlist) = App::Chart::SymbolMatch::find ($target) >>

=item C<< ($symbol, $symlist) = App::Chart::SymbolMatch::find ($target, $preferred_symlist) >>

Find a symbol for the partial string C<$target> in the symlists and return
the symbol and symlist, or return no values if nothing matches (which
include when C<$target> is the empty string C<"">).

Progressively looser matches are attempted.  So first an exact match in the
given C<$preferred_symlist>, otherwise other lists.  Otherwise a
case-insensitive match, or a match without suffix (but always following an
explicit suffix on C<$target>), or a partial match at the start of the
symbol, and possibly without the index "^" marker.

The effect is that for instance a C<$target> "bh" might match "BHP.AX", or
"gsp" might match "^GSPC".  Note that an exact match anywhere is preferred
over a partial match in the current list, because otherwise you could type
an exact full symbol like "FOO" and still be left on a "FOO.AX" in the
current list.
