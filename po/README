The translations here are mainly to see the setups work.  There's very
little actually translated, and most messages aren't settled enough to
want to put work into translating them.

"charset=UTF-8" should be used in .po files because that's what
App::Chart asks for, to become Perl wide-char strings everywhere
internally.  A charset other than utf-8 works, it just means gettext
must convert at runtime.  The .pot file, incidentally, is all ASCII.


The "msgctxt" context is used to distinguish separate uses of the same
or similar short string, in the usual way.

Context "manual-node" is a node name, ie. @node, in chart.texi.
Unless the manual is translated too then they should be left
untranslated to go to the English copy.
