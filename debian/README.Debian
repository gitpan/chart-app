The package "Recommends" are as follows,

* libcrypt-ssleay-perl - for data sources using "https:" secure-HTTP,
  as described in the manual.

* libdevel-stacktrace-perl or libdevel-backtrace-perl - for more info
  in the error dialog (good for bug reporting, pretty obscure unless
  you want to do some programming otherwise)

* libintl-xs-perl - faster gettext message translations, though the
  plain perl libintl-perl is also fine generally

* libset-intspan-fast-xs-perl - faster IntSpan bits, may help series
  read/write/redisplay

The package "Suggests" are as follows,

* libbsd-resource-perl, libdevel-arena-perl,
  libdevel-findblessedrefs-perl, libdevel-mallinfo-perl - further
  technical info in the Help/Diagnostics dialog, but otherwise not
  needed

* libfinance-quote-perl - prices from Finance::Quote, and needed for
  the .TSP data source

* libfinance-ta-perl, geniustrader - more indicators and averages.  As
  of June 2009 neither are in the Debian archive.

Other bits,

* chart.bash described under "Invocation" in the manual is installed
  as /etc/bash_completion.d/chart so it's loaded automatically by
  bash_completion, if you use that.

  /usr/share/perl5/App/Chart/chart.bash is a symlink to
  /etc/bash_completion.d/chart so the file can also be found in the
  usual place described in the manual.
